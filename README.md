# Fuel-and-payload-weight

This adds weight simulation; basically, you can press buttons in the UI to change the simulated fuel and payload weight. This allows you to test the performance of aircraft at various fuel and payload weights.

This isn't done, and won't be for a while. Currently, I only have support for the F-16. Next will be fighter jets and small prop planes, however support for every aircraft in GeoFS is going to take a while because of the sheer number of aircraft (60+), and the fact that each aircraft type has a different set of minimum and maximum wieghts.
